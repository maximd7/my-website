## Peer Feedback
> “Maybe put the About information before the key features…”  
— *Joshua Horton*  

> “It might be nice to add some screenshots for each of the Test Sites…”  
— *Rowan Lynn*  

## Changes Made
1. **Test-Sites:** Added Before/After screenshots for both CSS-lock and clipboard-replace demos, and updated CSS to keep cards uniform at all breakpoints.  
2. **Global:** Loaded Google Fonts (Orbitron & DM Serif Text), included a FontAwesome icon on the home title, and added a favicon.  
3. **Extra Credit:** Implemented a feature-comparison `<table>` on the home page.
